<h1>GENESIS</h1>
<div class="header">as known by Science</div>
<br>

<p>In the beginning there was
<a class="note" title="[literally, 'no thing']">nothing</a>,
and everything was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity">one</a>:
eternal and without measure.

<p>
<a class="note" title="[a reverent exclamation; awesomely, unexpectedly]"><i>Then,</i></a> the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe">universe</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">exploded</a> into being,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis">forming</a>
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">first element</a>
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">second element</a>
<a class="note" title="[omitted in some versions of the text]">in the proportion of three to one</a>,
creating the billions of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution">galaxies
and nebulae</a>;
and from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe" title="an eon is one billion years">thirteen eons ago</a>
comes the light from billions of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_III" title="Population III stars">ancestral suns</a>.

<p>The ancestral suns
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-proton_chain">burned the first element</a>
for several eons to form the second element and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium" title="Lithium">third element</a>
and so on down to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron-56" title="Iron">twenty-sixth element</a>;
and the ancestral suns
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse">collapsed</a>
each in their time, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">exploded in every direction</a>,
giving birth with their remains to billions of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_II#Population_II_stars" title="Population II stars">elder suns</a>.

<p>And the elder suns, having burned for several eons, collapsed each in their time, and exploded in every direction.  So the heavens are filled with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars">stars</a>, including the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun">Sun</a>: and they have
burned for several eons and will burn for several more.

<p>So the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_nucleosynthesis">ninety-two elements</a>
were created;
and they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet#Formation">settled to form the planets</a>, including the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a> which came to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit">orbit</a> the Sun;
and also the moons which came to orbit the planets, including one
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon">Moon</a>
which came to orbit the Earth.

<p>The Earth
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_rotation">spun</a>
night and day and night again, and the rock and ocean and atmosphere
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_differentiation">were separate</a>
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth">five eons ago</a>;
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano">volcanoes</a>
made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain">mountains</a>;
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River">rivers</a> carved the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canyon">canyons</a>; and the Moon
brought the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides">tides</a>;
and the wind blew and the rain fell without question.

<p><a class="note"><i>Then,</i></a>
in the ocean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_life">there
came to be</a> a form of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world_hypothesis">proto-life</a>,
which was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_reproduction">reproduction</a>;
reproduction begat
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">evolution</a>;
evolution begat
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism">metabolism</a>;
and by four eons ago there were
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote">simple cells</a>.

<p>Some simple cells became
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria">proto-plants</a>,
which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis">drank light from the sun</a>;
but their
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_Catastrophe">waste accumulated and became poison</a>
to them.  And so some simple cells became
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_organism">aerobia</a>,
which ate the bodies and breathed the waste; and by three eons ago the
proto-plants and aerobia had come to equilibrium in the oceans, and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen" title="Oxygen">eighth element</a>
had come to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_cycle" title="21%">equilibrium</a>
in the atmosphere.

<p>The simple cells and proto-plants and aerobia evolved independently;
and by two eons ago 
they had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis">merged</a>
into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote">compound cells</a>,
which drink from the Sun, and also the Earth.

<p>
Some compound cells
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_multicellularity">became joined</a>
and formed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral">coral</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus">fungus</a>;
and one cell brought forth many cells that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_cell">grew differently</a>,
yet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism">functioned as one</a>.
And by one eon ago, vegetation had covered the earth.

<p>Vegetation became
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatophyte">plants yielding seed</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree">trees</a> bearing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit">fruit</a> in which is their seed,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiosperms">flowers</a> feeding
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect">insects</a> which
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-evolution">spread their seed</a>.
And there came to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish">fish</a>
in the ocean, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds">birds</a>
in the air, and all manner of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals">animals</a>
along the ground; the stronger eats the smaller and the weakest
drinks from the sun, and it is equilibrium.

<p><i>Then,</i> it came to pass that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australopithicus"><em>australopithicus</em></a>,
which walked upright on two feet, begat
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_habilis"><em>homo habilis</em></a>,
which hunted with tools; <em>habilis</em> begat
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus"><em>homo erectus</em></a>,
which captured fire; and <em>erectus</em> begat
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens"><em>homo sapiens</em></a>,
which moved their tongues in speech.

<p>Now it is the end of eons; and <em>homo sapiens</em> is man and woman.
