<p>In the beginning there was everything, and everything was one; eternal and without measure.</p>

<p>And the universe exploded into being, and the first element and the second element were formed, creating the billions of galaxies and nebulae; and by the thirteenth eon there were billions of ancestral suns.</p>

<p>The ancestral suns burned for several eons, and formed the second element and the third element and so on down to the twenty-sixth element; and the ancestral suns imploded and exploded at their end, and formed every element down to the ninety-second element, from which arose the billions of elder suns.</p>

<p>The elder suns burned for several more eons, and further formed the second and third and so on down to the twenty-sixth element;  

<p>And the elder suns imploded and exploded, and the heavens were filled with stars, including our sun, to burn for several eons; and also the planets including the earth, which came to orbit our sun; and also our moon, which came to orbit the earth.</p>

<p>So the earth spun night and day, and the rock and ocean and atmosphere were separate by the fifth eon; and volcanoes made the mountains; and rivers cut the canyons; and the moon brought the tides; and the wind blew and the rain fell without question.</p>

<p>In the ocean there came to be a form of proto-life, which was reproduction; reproduction begat evolution; evolution begat metabolism; and by the fourth eon there were simple cells.</p>

<p>Some simple cells became proto-plants, which ate from the sun; but their waste accumulated and became poison to them.  And some simple cells became aerobia, which ate the bodies and breathed the waste; and by the third eon this waste had come to equilibrium in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The simple cells and proto-plants and aerobia evolved independently; and by the second eon they had merged into compound cells, which ate from the sun, and also the earth.</p>

<p>Some compound cells joined together, to become coral and fungus; and one cell brought forth many cells that grew differently, yet functioned as one.  And by the first eon, the earth had vegetation.</p>

<p>Vegetation became plants yielding seed, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, and flowers feeding insects which spread their seed.  And there came to be fish in the ocean, and birds in the air, and all manner of animals along the ground; the larger ate the weaker and the smallest ate the plants, and it was equilibrium.
</p>

<p>And it came to pass that <em>australopithicus</em>, which walked upright on two feet, begat <em>homo habilis</em>, which hunted with tools; habilis begat <em>erectus</em>, which captured fire; erectus begat <em>sapiens</em>, who were man
and woman; and at the end of the first eon, sapiens were awake.
