## Exodus

And so it came to pass: *australopithicus*, who walked on two feet, begat *homo habilis*, who hunted with tools; habilis begat *erectus*, who captured fire; and erectus begat *sapiens*, who were man and woman.

The Spirit moved the tongues of man and woman, and gave them words:

    Behold the stone and the soil, I call them earth;
    and the rains and rivers and oceans, I call these water;
    and breath and wind and fog, I call this air;
    and the flame, large and small; I call it fire.

    Nothing shall go without a name,
    and nothing that is named shall be forgotten,
    and every child shall learn to speak these names,
    and therefore shall our people prosper.

And so men gave names to the trees and the animals and the tools, and women gave names to the herbs and the birds and their children;

The tribes of Indonesia swam to the islands in the East;
and the tribes of Africa expanded to the South;
and the tribes of Europe endured the North.

Thus every child had a different name, and every child learned to speak their names, and many tribes in many lands were blessed.

Then in the East erupted a huge volcano; and the sky was covered with smoke, and the sun did not shine for many seasons. Many plants
withered; many trees did not bear fruit; many animals were hungry and
lean; and children in every land were starved and died.  Many tribes
did not survive.

But after many years the sky cleared, and the sun shone again, and the plants grew
back, and the trees again bore fruit, and the animals were again fed.

The tribes of Asia populated the East;
and the tribes of Africa expanded again to the South;
and the tribes of Europe endured again the North;
and the tribes of America crossed a bridge of ice from Asia;
so the races of Earth came to be.
